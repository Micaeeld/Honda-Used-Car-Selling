# Exploratory Data Analysis - Honda Car Sales
This notebook contains exploratory data analysis and price prediction for Honda cars at a specific store, available from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/themrityunjaypathak/honda-car-selling.

## Context
Car sales are an important sector of the economy in many countries. Data analytics can help companies identify patterns and trends in sales and consumer behavior. Furthermore, price forecasting can help the company adjust its pricing strategies.

## Dataset
The "Honda Used Car Selling" dataset contains information about sales of Honda cars at a specific store. It contains information about the car model, year of manufacture, price, mileage, among other variables.

## Exploratory data analysis
In this notebook, I performed an exploratory analysis of the data in order to identify the main trends in Honda car sales. Some of the main aspects I investigated were:

- Distribution of car models sold
- Average selling price by car model
- Distribution of years of manufacture of cars sold
- Relationship between price and other variables

## Price forecast
In addition to exploratory data analysis, I performed a Honda car price forecast using regression. From the variables available in the dataset, I trained a regression model to predict car prices. The model was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric and presented a satisfactory performance.

## Results
The results from this notebook can help the Honda car dealership identify which car models and years are selling the most and adjust their pricing strategies. In addition, the analysis can be useful for other companies that want to better understand the Honda car sales market.
